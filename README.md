# Mitchell_Jesse_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Our project is a simple address book and calender using a binary tree and a linked list respectively.
The BST  and LL would be organized by name and saved into a file so it can be used more than once. Some functionalities might include adding, editing, and removing contacts and appointments, sending emails (maybe) and searching/traversing the data strcutures. As of now we'll only be using standard libraries and it will probably only be usable on mac and linux.
